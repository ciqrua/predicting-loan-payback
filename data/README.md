# Dataset Description

This project uses tabular loan data from a Kaggle Playground competition.

## Data Source

- Kaggle Playground Series (Season 5, Episode 11)
- Task: Predict whether a loan will be paid back (`loan_paid_back`)

Due to licensing and file size considerations, the raw dataset is **not included**
in this GitHub repository.

## Expected Files

After downloading the dataset from Kaggle, the `data/` directory should contain:

- `train.csv`: training data with features and target label
- `test.csv`: test data without target label

## Notes

- The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features
- Missing values are handled during preprocessing in the notebook
- File paths may need to be adjusted depending on your local environment
